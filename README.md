# IntelliJ_Java_FileFinderProject
File search programm (in progress) (windows)

Intention: creating a fast and smart file search programm that can handel big collections of folder/file sections for servers or high number of drivers on a computer.

Added improvements:
 - enter InputField -> searching for file on all Drivers, list the files
 - enter PathInput -> searching for all files withing the path
 - onclick on row(file) inside the JTable opens the file with relevant programm
 - Add button -> opens Frame -> displays selected file inside the JTable
 - Help button shows how everything is working (Fields / Buttons)

Coming improvements:
 - search List -> searches for all written files
 - Auto getAllDriver -> selected Driver -> searching only on selected driver
 - Database
 - ?
